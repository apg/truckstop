"""search.py: Indexes for searching for food trucks!

This module defines two types of indexes, and then combines them into
a single index that can be queried with lots of different options.

First, we have a text index, DocumentIndex. This is done quite simply
by utilizing dot products of term frequencies across the set of
documents.  It's more or less a "poor man's text index" and requires
that we iterate over all documents per query. As such, we'll
prioritize the Spatial index first when possible.

There are a number of improvements to be made here. First, a search
for "tea" won't bring up "teas" or "iced-tea." The first example could
be solved by stemming all the words, making "teas" be stored as "tea",
and therefore counting towards an additional occurance of "tea." An
example algorithm for doing this is Porter. I haven't included this 
here (though this documentation may be out of date if I can find an
implementation -- it's rather complicated to implement just for this
exercise).


The second index type is for spatial searches. Since Food Trucks in SF
(I assume given the data) are permitted to operate at set locations,
we have an address and lat / lon of there permitted location. Thus, we
can easily build a KD-Tree (though other types of trees, such as an
Octree or Quad-tree would work) to eliminate trucks from our search
that are out of range.

In reality, searching for food trucks essentially comes down to this:

  - If given a max travel distance, find trucks within that range.
  - Of that set, keep the ones that the text query keeps
  - Order by some combined score (maybe prioritize distance over 
    relevance)

One can expand upon this by expanding the travel distance and offering
places that match the search terms, specifying to the user "We didn't
find anything in your range, but these things are just a bit
further...".

    A simpler way to get similar results would be to remove the most common
