    Document("In Pieces", """No matter how much I say that I've learned life's lessons,
the only way to ever really know life's lessons
is when it smacks you right in the face
(life smacks you in the face)
Rubberband stretched to the limit,
but still I cannot help but pull it just a little bit more.
Once again my whole world crumbles, walls cave in, i fall backwards.
Everything I know taken out at the knee.
Hands stuffed deep into my mouth
to keep from choking on the words that show
how much i know about knowing nothing at all
(I dont know anything at all)
I know that these days will have an end just like i know
that I'll be back again.
This place is awful, but its familiar."""),
    Document("Count Me Out", """I can still see the reasons
that I opened my eyes to this scene in the first place.
I can still feel my beleifs growing stronger - stronger everyday.
I can still count the ways but for you its all over.
The feeling is gone and you're moving on
and tearing us down with you.
You've shed your past.
Grown up fast, demanding that we all mature at your pace.
But here I'll remain refusing to change remembering
when we were the same I support your decision,
I believe in change and hope you find just what it is that you are looking for.
But when you sit around and talk shit about everything
that you once based your whole life on,
well that is where you can count me out.
Because I will be here tomorrow, and I will be here next
year, just like this X on the back of my hand, I'm not going nowhere."""),
    Document("Superhero", """She rolls her eyes and lights another.
"One day I'll quit these things they're killing me"
She blows her brains right out her fucking mouth
"I just don't know how you do it"
Well, there is nothing in me
that you don't have deep within your fucking self.
Yes, the body is week but the mind is strong
and it controls the body,
you are not a slave, and I am not a superhero.
The difference between hard
and impossible is a thousand miles wide,
but that's not what you want to hear.
So you live a lifetime of regret
instead of moments of uncomfort
never knowing how great it feels to be free."""),
    Document("At Best", """Searching, sifting, dying to find the worst in everything around you.
All that's wrong is all that you fuckin' see
because its all that you look for.
But you won't wallow in your doom alone
you've got to ruin it for everyone.
With words that belittle the situation
and rape each moment of its potential.
I'm not saying to go through life blindly.
I know that things don't go right all of the time.
But at best - I am going to try to find, at best
a way to make it through the haze, at best
I'm gonna leave your words behind, so I can get on with my day.
It only takes a little bit of effort,
to open up your eyes and see,
that this life is so fucking short
but still let each day of it get the best of you,
instead of the other way around.
Someone has killed the child in you,
and now this life has got you beat."""),
    Document("Scared", """You go on without me I'll hold right here.
That gleam in your eyes, it still fills me with fear.
The more you see that I'm not like the others
the harder you try to take my hand in yours.
Cold grey and callous, reaching out for me.
Whatever's over that that hill, it scares the fuck out of me.
Still you step closer, so that our eyes can meet.
Tell me no one knows me, like you do.
And then you say that I can't play this game forever.
No, you are the king of killers.
I've seen what you do.
Carving through the hearts
and souls of many with cloven hoofs you stomp the dreams of men,
of men far greater that me.
I'm not going I'll hold here."""),
    Document("Forked Tongue", """What have you done
Look at what you have done
Screaming words of venom
Right in your daughters face
Take the time to show her
That all her thoughts were wrong
Shape her in your image
Just as somebody did to you
And if this is how you do it
When you're right in front of me
I can not imagine what must go down at home
Never got a chance
That kid was doomed right at the gate
I stand and watch you ruin that poor little girl
In the middle of the street
And since I can't put a bullet right in your hateful face
I turn my back and walk away and hope there is a hell
And soon she'll know just how to use words that cripple
That cripple like a gun
What have you done"""),
    Document("Every Effort Made", """Holding this moment in the palm of my hands
This thing still means so much to me
Beliefs that have stood the test of time
A force that surrounds us
Penetrates us
Binds us all together
These days belong to us
It's in the things that we said
All that it meant
Ideals that won't fade
And every effort made
And it's much more so much more than just fucking clothes
It's in the way that you cannot sit still
Chewing on words but spitting out actions
Fire the fire that burns so deep inside
The fire that keeps hardcore alive"""),
    Document("Lay The Blame", """Again- again left with this lesson that is not mine to learn
Tears regret and painful questions it smashes your spine
Steals all that time
And takes the eyes right out of your head
But we don't point a finger
Nobody says a word
But it rips us apart
That old man I looked up to
Passed out on the floor
That stupid crazy motherfucker
Taking all those lives
The one the love my mother
Poisoned from inside
What it did to me ripped us apart
And you how did it get to you
The smartest of us all
It knocked you down and beat you up
But neither you or it would ever let it go
And again I pay the price""")
